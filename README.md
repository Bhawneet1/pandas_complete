# pandas

This repository contains a comprehensive journey through the complete `pandas` library, covering all fundamental and advanced features. It includes two major projects:

1. **Anime Feature Extraction Project:**  
   Demonstrates feature extraction techniques using an anime dataset.
2. **Countries Data Insights Project:**  
   Provides insightful analysis and visualizations on a dataset of countries.

Both projects are implemented in Python using the `pandas` library, and serve as practical examples for mastering data manipulation and analysis.

## About

This repository aims to provide a beginner-to-advanced walkthrough of the `pandas` library. By working through the code and projects here, you will learn:

- Data manipulation and cleaning
- Feature engineering
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Data aggregation, grouping, and pivoting
- Handling missing values
- Merging and joining datasets
- Visualization with pandas and matplotlib

---

## Features

- **Complete pandas tutorials and notebooks**
- **Real-world projects for hands-on practice**
- **Well-commented code for easy understanding**
- **Best practices for data preprocessing and analysis**

## Projects

### Anime Feature Extraction

- **Objective:** Extract features from an anime dataset to prepare for machine learning or statistical analysis.
- **Key Steps:**
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing
  - Handling categorical and numerical features
  - Creating new features (feature engineering)
  - Exploratory data analysis

#### Example Code Snippet

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the anime dataset
df = pd.read_csv('anime.csv')

# Basic cleaning
df.dropna(subset=['genre'], inplace=True)
df['genre'] = df['genre'].str.split(',')

# Feature engineering: Count number of genres
df['num_genres'] = df['genre'].apply(len)

# Display top 5
print(df.head())
```

### Countries Data Insights

- **Objective:** Gain insights from a dataset containing information about countries.
- **Key Steps:**
  - Data aggregation and grouping (e.g., by continent)
  - Statistical summaries (mean, median, etc.)
  - Visualizations (bar charts, histograms, etc.)
  - Finding correlations and trends

#### Example Code Snippet

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the countries dataset
df = pd.read_csv('countries.csv')

# Group by continent and calculate average population
continent_pop = df.groupby('continent')['population'].mean().sort_values(ascending=False)

print("Average population by continent:")
print(continent_pop)

# Visualization example
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

continent_pop.plot(kind='bar', title='Average Population by Continent')
plt.ylabel('Population')
plt.show()
```
